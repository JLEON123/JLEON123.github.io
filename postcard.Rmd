## Bio

<p class="paragraph1">
I am an undergraduate student at Utah Valley University studying <a style="font-size:100%;"href="https://www.uvu.edu/catalog/current/departments/biology/bioinformatics-bs/" target = "_blank">Bioinformatics</a> while also obtaining a certificate in <a style="font-size:100%;" href="https://www.uvu.edu/catalog/current/departments/earth-science/geographic-information-systems-certificate-of-proficiency/" target = "_blank">Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</a>. I was granted the <a style="font-size:100%;"href="https://www.uvu.edu/biology/s_stem_scholarship.html" target = "_blank">NSF S-STEM scholarship</a> my second year at UVU, allowing me to have a strong focus on research that interests me as an undergraduate. Currently, I am working on three research projects and was apart of one that is undergoing peer-review. My research interests deal with plant-microbe interactions, microbial biogeography and utilizing GIS/remote sensing techniques for ecology related questions. My hope is to continue my education after UVU and earn a PhD in a biology related field. </p>
